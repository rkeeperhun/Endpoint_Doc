### ðŸ”Œ Use custom order_number
If it's enabled on the endpoint server it's possible to use custom order_number. The order_number is a unique identifier for the order and will be used on the restaurant terminal side.

#### Notes
- **Important** It has to be  enabled on the endpoint server. Please ask the server provider to make it avilable for you.
- If it's not enabled, the server will ignore the extra field and fall back the default order_number.
- If the custom `order_number` option is enabled but the POST request doesn't contain the `order_number` field, the server will fall back the default order_number.
- The `order_number` must be numeric and between 0 and 99999.

#### Data / payload
The payload of the POST request is the same as the one for the POST order. But you can provide an extra field `order_number` with the order_number you want to use.

#### Example payload
